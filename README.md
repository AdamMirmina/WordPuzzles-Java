# Word Puzzles (Java)

A collection of classic word-based console games built in Java — including Wordle, Spelling Bee, and Anagrams — all playable from a single interactive menu.

## Features
- Wordle: Guess the hidden five-letter word with color-coded feedback for each letter.
- Spelling Bee: Form as many valid words as possible in 2 minutes using a letter set with a required center letter.
- Anagrams: Unscramble a word as quickly as possible, with optional shuffles and hints (with time penalties).
- Color-coded terminal output for a more engaging play experience.
- Keeps track of player statistics (streaks, high scores, best times) between games.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Core language)
- ANSI escape codes for color output
- Threads for real-time game timers
- File I/O for loading word lists and puzzles
